The task involves creating a Python script for practical cybersecurity analysis of system logs. The script reads a log file, filters relevant events such as failed logins or access denials, performs time-based analysis to identify patterns, and generates a cybersecurity report. The report includes details of found events and an analysis of activity patterns based on hours. The code is designed for simplicity, readability, and ease of understanding, making it suitable for practical applications.
